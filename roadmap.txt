Got a couple of things to do.

1. Format shit cause intellisense is actually dog ✅
2. Figure out item equip (kinda workin on it)
4. ADD A DO WHILE FOR DECISION 2 ✅
5. Add option for nothing in your inventory when fighting.
6. Copy all the suff from (decision2 == 2) to inside (decision2_1 == "1") ✅
7. Figure out why input ("3") for decision1 makes you press 2-3 keys instead of 1.
8. Turn shit into methods i'm kinda hating it now. Finished to decisionMethod2, still partially done with decisionConditional2, 
   just copypasta and finish the array issues. (tuples!!!) NOTE: IF ANYTHING FUNKY GOES ON WITH THE INVENTORY ITS CAUSE OF "decisionConditional2."
